TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS


Process Description

Section A: Preparing The Test Set
* Step A.1: Getting the authentication credential
* Step A.2: Authenticating our Python script
* Step A.3: Creating the function to build the Test set

Section B: Preparing The Training Set

Section C: Pre-processing Tweets in The Data Sets- this process includes removing of URLs, usernames, hashtags, tokenizing etc. Both, our trainingData and testDataSet are preprocessed here

Section D: Naive Bayes Classifier

* Step D.1: Building the vocabulary- Build a vocabulary (list of words) of all the words resident in our processed training data set using nltk.FreqDist().
 
* Step D.2: Matching tweets against our vocabulary

* Step D.3: Building our feature vector

* Step D.4: Training the classifier- it will only take us a function call to train the model as a Naive Bayes Classifier, since the latter is built into the library.i.e nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(trainingFeatures)

Section E: Testing The Model
